# Robotics-Projects
Projects from the Robotics Class. Programs are written in C using [C4EV3](https://github.com/c4ev3/EV3-API) API and using [ev3duder](https://github.com/c4ev3/ev3duder) to write the program on the robot. Some of these projects are 

# Index
1. Computing Forward Kinematics for a Robot with 3 arms and 2 offsets
2. Program a Diiferential Drive Lego Robot to drive itself in a discretized world with known obstacles and goal position coordinates
3. Program a Mobile Robot to scan a room and drive itself for extinguishing candle-fire and devise a mechanism to take out the candle-fire using any fire-resistant techniques based on the constraint that the candle-fire is kept on a particular coloured tile in the world
4. UPCOMING


## Platform
These programs are written to run on Linux serve Omega at the University. For MAC OS, it require XQuartz and for a Windows machine it need Xming server.

## Running Kinematics Program on a Omega Server through MAC

```bash
ssh -X --username --password
makefile
